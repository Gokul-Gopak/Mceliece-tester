# mceliece

## Overview

The [Classic McEliece](https://classic.mceliece.org) post-quantum asymmetric
cypher compiled to WebAssembly using [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).
A simple JavaScript wrapper is provided to make McEliece easy to use in web applications.

The default parameter set is mceliece8192128 (roughly 256-bit strength).

## Example Usage

	import {mceliece} from 'mceliece';

	const keyPair /*: {privateKey: Uint8Array; publicKey: Uint8Array} */ =
		await mceliece.keyPair()
	;

	const {cyphertext, secret} /*: {cyphertext: Uint8Array; secret: Uint8Array} */ =
		await mceliece.encrypt(keyPair.publicKey)
	;

	const decrypted /*: Uint8Array */ =
		await mceliece.decrypt(cyphertext, keyPair.privateKey) // same as secret
	;

	console.log(keyPair);
	console.log(secret);
	console.log(cyphertext);
	console.log(decrypted);

## Changelog

Breaking changes in major versions:

5.0.0:

* Switched from McBits to Classic McEliece. For backwards compatibility with previous versions
of this package, use
[mceliece-legacy](https://github.com/cyph/pqcrypto.js/tree/master/packages/mceliece-legacy).

4.0.0:

* Cyphertext generated by mceliece 4.x is incompatible with that of mceliece 3.x, and vice versa:

  - Upgraded to McBits 2.0 and switched symmetric cypher from Salsa20 to ChaCha20.

  - Fixed a bug that sometimes caused invalid output.

  - Decreased maximum plaintext size from 403 to 106 (for consistency with ntru, as well as
    smaller output).

3.0.0:

* As part of upgrading from asm.js to WebAssembly (with asm.js included as a fallback),
the API is fully asynchronous.

2.0.0:

* Switched to McBits from [HyMES](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/CBCrypto/index.php?pg=hymes).

* Removed some undocumented functions as part of minor API cleanup.
